Our idea is to create a local network by connecting devices to a device with wi-fi driver capable of providing hotspot in the areas affected by cyclone.
The connectivity happens with the driver enabling hotspot in the driver for the devices to be connected through wi-fi.
In case if the areas affected by cyclone loses network connectivity then the people in the affected area can be reached by connecting to the hotspot of the rescue team.
By connecting to the hotspot of the driver people can communicate with the rescue team.They receive guidance from the team.
To expand the area of coverage of the hotspot,wi-fi repeater can be used.
Several hotspots can be created to expand the range of connectivity and to ensure that all the affected people could be reached.
By sharing the ip address of the server to the clients we establish a local communication network.
The application used by the server must be installed in the clients device.
Using this platform people can communicate with the rescue team.
